title: The Magic of Reinforcement Learning (part 1)
---

In this post, I will present some interesting and somewhat "magical" (at least, to me :-) ) stuffs about Reinforcement Learning (RL), via some simple scenarios.
By the end of this post, I hope you will also be thrilled by the capability of what RL can bring.

This is the first part of a planned 3 parts I want to write about RL. These posts are for everybody even one with not much prior knowledge in RL, to understand the great power of the stochasticity property of the behaviour of the learned agents.
