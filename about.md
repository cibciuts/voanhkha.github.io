I graduated PhD in Machine Learning with additional background on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2019. I have a mixed expertise on both academia (lecturer at HoChiMinh City University of Technology in 2015, research assistant at University of New South Wales in 2018), as well as industry (electrical engineer at Ascenx Technologies from 2014-2015, firmware engineer at Seldat Inc in 2016, and data scientist intern at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2019). I am now working as a full-time post-doc in Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) at UTS, as well as other aspects of RL.

The strongest point in me is the ability to "human learn" various mathematical aspects of research rapidly, ranging from optimization, machine learning, to reinforcement learning. It is demonstrated via my rapid-growing ranking in the global data scientist leaderboard on Kaggle. I joined Kaggle from March 2018, and now (August 2019) I have myself 3 gold medals and 3 silver medals in almost totally diverse aspects of competitions, including mathematical optimization, semi-supervised clustering, tree-based modelling oriented supervised ML, and GCN-oriented supervised ML. The full details of awards are outlined in the "Kaggle Awards" section below.
