I graduated PhD in Machine Learning with additional background on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2019. I have a mixed expertise on both academia (lecturer at HoChiMinh City University of Technology in 2015, research assistant at University of New South Wales in 2018), as well as industry (electrical engineer at Ascenx Technologies from 2014-2015, firmware engineer at Seldat Inc in 2016, and data scientist intern at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2019). I am now working as a full-time post-doc in mainly in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) at UTS, Australia.

The strongest point in me is the ability to "human learn" various mathematical aspects of research in a very short time, ranging from optimization, machine learning, to reinforcement learning. It is demonstrated via my rapid-growing ranking in the global data scientist leaderboard on Kaggle. I joined Kaggle from March 2018, and now (August 2019) I have myself 3 gold medals and 3 silver medals in almost totally diverse aspects of competitions, including mathematical optimization, semi-supervised clustering, tree-based modelling oriented supervised ML, and GCN-oriented supervised ML. The full details of awards are outlined in the "Kaggle Awards" section below.

### What I hope for

Although I have in my hands some publications, I never satisfied with any of them. The reason is that due to some reasons, I had to strive to complete my PhD in a very short time, hence I had to push my published papers too much.

As a result, I always hope that I can publish some papers in high-quality conferences or journals soon, such as ICML, NIPS, or at least AAAI. I also want to be a top 10 data scientist on Kaggle global leaderboard (oops, that can be considered an extremely tough and long-term goal).

For a little bit further in the future, I hope I can either establish a small AI company, or I can work as a researcher for big AI teams in the world, such as Microsoft Research or Google AI, only when I have enough wide and deep knowledge, skills, and/or stable financial situation.
