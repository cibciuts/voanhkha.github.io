I graduated PhD in Machine Learning (ML) with additional background on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2019. I am now working as a full-time post-doc in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) at UTS, Australia.

### What I hope for

Although I have in my hands some publications, I never satisfied with any of them. The reason is that due to personal reasons, I had to strive to complete my PhD in a very short time, hence I had to push my published papers too much.

As a result, I always hope that I can publish some papers in high-quality conferences or journals soon, such as ICML, NIPS, or at least AAAI. I also want to be a top 10 data scientist on Kaggle global leaderboard (oops, that can be considered an extremely tough and long-term goal).

For a little bit further in the future, I hope I can either establish a small AI company, or I can work as a researcher for big AI teams in the world, such as Microsoft Research or Google AI, only when I have enough wide and deep knowledge, skills, and/or stable financial situation.
